# arman

Hi, this is arman.

arman is short for **ar**tist **man**agement software.

At it's core, arman is a content management system with an admin dashboard.

At the moment, here is what arman is primarily built with:
- [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) for HTTP routing and handling
- [jackc/pgx](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5) for its PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go

I'm sure that list will steadily grow, but I'm aiming to keep things light.

Here are some features arman aims to have:
- Streamlined management of classical repertoire (composers & pieces)
- Simplified programme creation
- Robust and practical event management (drafting, publishing, and archiving)

The feature set will definitely grow, but I'm trying to keep things focused for now (-.-)
